# HomeBuilderBlinds Intelligence Suite

**Comprehensive Signal Aggregation and Innovation Mapping System for Real Asset Operators, Vendors, and Strategic Builders**

---

## Project Overview

This project is designed to develop a modular intelligence framework that aggregates, parses, and analyzes economic signals, public records, innovation filings, and competitive activity across several adjacent industries. These include window treatments, construction subcontracting, smart home integration, warehouse logistics, multifamily real estate, and materials science.

The system synthesizes diverse data—including patents, academic publications, funding rounds, procurement listings, incorporation records, and open-source project signals—into actionable intelligence. The end goal is to arm decision-makers, vendors, investors, and operators with the clearest possible picture of where markets, methods, and materials are heading next.

This is not a feature tracker or a market summary. It is a **competitive operating system** for those building businesses in the real world—with the infrastructure and depth of a future Fortune 500 player.

## Data Architecture

The intelligence suite operates through a carefully orchestrated data pipeline that converts diverse signals into actionable insights:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Sources → Load Processes → Initial Storage
  - External data origins (market, patents, academic)
  - Application-generated signals
  - Real-time data streams
  - Normalized through data load processes
  - Event-driven architecture for real-time signals

- **Storage Ecosystem**: Strategic data repositories
  - Data Warehouse for structured, processed information
  - Data Lake for raw, unprocessed datasets
  - Data Lakehouse combining warehouse structure with lake flexibility

- **Processing Framework**: Signal transformation engines
  - Batch Processing for high-volume historic analysis
  - Stream Processing for real-time event handling
  - Cross-processing integration for comprehensive insights

- **Analytics & Output Delivery**: Intelligence manifestation

# CrossRef Tech Signals Dashboard

**This is the front-end module of the intelligence suite used for real-time scoring and innovation tracking.**

---

## Mission

The goal of this tool is to track **emerging technology**, **materials**, and **business signals** in construction and real estate—especially where automation, patents, or academic research signals the next wave of disruption.

---

## Why It Matters

This dashboard is built to answer questions like:

- What patents are being filed around smart home energy systems, blind motors, or self-healing surfaces?
- Which startups are receiving funding to digitize inspections, automate drywalling, or embed sensors in flooring?
- Are academic labs quietly prototyping construction robotics or AI-based HVAC load prediction?

When a topic shows up in **multiple signals (patents + papers + funding + open-source code)**, it’s a sign the market is about to shift.
